This is going to be a very bare bones chat application built with node express server, mongoDB database, angular framework. The main goal of the project is to get comfortable building an app from beginning to end with a server and a database. The project timeline will proceed as follows:
-Compose a package.json document
-Build out file path
  -Model and controller on client side
  -Model and collection on server side
  -Have a views folder containing html to be rendered to page
-Compose index.html
-Start node server
  -Have node server serve index.html
-Start a mongoDB database and connect it to the server with mongoose
